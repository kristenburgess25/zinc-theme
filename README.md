### Why WindiCSS?

While constructing our build process, it was found that building Tailwind via Vite took approximately 12 seconds to complete. Obviously this is *not* an ideal build time when you consider that this action would be happening every time a production build is attempted. ðŸ˜… So to cut down on time during our Github PR actions *and* initial local development, the decision was made to switch to Windi [per this suggestion from Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1361353445379366912?s=20&t=_lSvaDi5Syge3c1ZtqPsWw), creator of Vue & Vite.

# Getting Started

## Pre-Reqs

- [Node (npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli)

## Installation

1. Clone repo via your preferred method, urls can be found above in the top right.

## Scripts

### `npm run build`

This is the standard action for building assets on the fly. It will bundle everything as configured in the main `scripts/theme.js` and serve them as production-ready assets in the `assets` directory.

### `npm run dev`

For when you need to do your local development - bundles all assets in the same fashion as a standard build, but also watches the appropriate directories for live updates!

### `npm run lint`

Runs all linters across the appropriate directories.

* **`lint:styles`**

  Runs StyleLint in the `styles` directory.

* **`lint:scripts`**
  
  Runs ESLint in the root directory.

* **`lint:liquid`**
  
  Runs theme check in the root directory.

### `npm run tests`

Runs all tests from Cypress in a pre-configured environment based on the Theme Store Requirements.

* **`tests:open`**

  Opens Cypress to run tests manually.
